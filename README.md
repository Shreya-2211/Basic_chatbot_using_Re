# Basic_chatbot_using_Re

Learning about chatbots using NLP and computational Linguistics.
Here I contemplated using spaCy and RE, and decided to go with 'Re' as this project doesnot require any wide range of functionalities that SpaCy has to offer.
(and also SpaCy took a lot of time to get imported and installed :/)

This project however needs to be developed more as it doesn't take any other values except the one predefined as 'questions' with predefined 'answers'.
